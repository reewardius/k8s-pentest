Delete all logs
```
> ./del_logs.sh

- Note: This method only deletes the logs stored on the node where the pods are running and 
- not the logs stored in a centralized logging solution like Elasticsearch, Fluentd, or Kibana.

Delete all events

```
> kubectl delete events --all

Pod or container name similarity
```
- Pods that are created by controllers such as Deployment or DaemonSet have random suffix in their names. 
- Attackers can use this fact and name their backdoor pods as they were created by the existing controllers. 
- For example, an attacker could create a malicious pod named coredns-{random suffix} which would look related to the CoreDNS Deployment.
